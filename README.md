# Cross-X: Web Sharing App

This project is a cross-platform web application that allows users to share images and text between devices (Android, iOS, Windows, etc.) via a browser. The frontend is built with Vite (vanilla JS). A Node.js/Express backend will be added for sharing APIs.

## Features
- Upload and share images
- Share and copy text
- View shared content from any device

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the frontend:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
3. (Backend setup instructions will be added soon)

## Notes
- No authentication for demo purposes.
- Works on any device with a modern browser.
